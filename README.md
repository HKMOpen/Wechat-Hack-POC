# Wechat-Hack-POC


POC of what Xposed can do.

Actually, it is very unsafe to use Xposed, even more dangerous than root: it will show no permission requesting dialogs. If we implement it in some normal applications, we even can use it to do something evil.

Wechat does not implement any safe mechanism (although useless). This is very insecure.

Thanks to fkzhang for the insights.
